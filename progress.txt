# Rabbitbrain Implementation Progress

## 2026-02-13T00:00:00Z - Milestone 1: Progress log scaffolding
- Learning: Current app is share-only in CLI/API/UI, with no recommendation payload contract.
- Changes: Added this `progress.txt` file with milestone logging structure.
- Verification: File created and tracked in git.

## 2026-02-13T00:00:00Z - Milestone 2: Shared analyze engine contract
- Learning: TypeScript `allowJs: false` requires a `.d.ts` contract for shared `.mjs` modules consumed by API code.
- Changes: Added `lib/analysis/engine.mjs` and `lib/analysis/engine.d.ts` with deterministic analyze output schema.
- Verification: Module exports cover URL validation, post/context fetch, analysis synthesis, and recommendation generation.

## 2026-02-13T00:00:00Z - Milestone 3: API and persistence wiring
- Learning: Importing `.mjs` into TS under path aliases required an explicit ambient module declaration (`types/analysis-engine.d.ts`).
- Changes: Wired `app/api/analyze/route.ts` to shared engine and extended Convex schema/mutation/types for enriched analysis payloads.
- Verification: `npm run typecheck` passes.
